# Medicine Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This repository contains a **Medicine Sales Forecasting** model using time-series analysis techniques to predict future sales trends. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze past sales data and make accurate predictions, which can be used for inventory management and decision-making in the pharmaceutical sector.

## Features
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Predicts future medicine sales based on historical data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes algorithms such as **SARIMA** (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for forecasting.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses data to remove noise and improve model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generates trend graphs and insights for better understanding.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for different datasets and extended with additional features.

## Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NishatJillani/Medicine-Sales-Forecasting.git
   cd Medicine-Sales-Forecasting
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the dataset**: Place your sales data file in the appropriate folder (e.g., `data/medicine_sales.csv`).
2. **Run the forecasting model**:
   ```bash
   python forecast.py
   ```
3. **View results**: The forecasted sales data and visualizations will be generated in the `output/` directory.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain the following columns:
- `Date`: Timestamp of sales data.
- `Sales`: Number of medicines sold.
- (Optional) Additional features such as seasonality, holidays, or promotions.

## Model Implementation
The project primarily implements **SARIMA** (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time-series forecasting. SARIMA is chosen due to its ability to handle seasonal patterns effectively, making it the best fit for this project.

### Why SARIMA?
- Accounts for **seasonality**, which is common in medicine sales.
- Handles **trend and cyclic variations** efficiently.
- Works well with limited data compared to deep learning models like LSTMs.

## Results & Visualization
- Forecasted sales trends.
- Comparative analysis of different models.
- Graphs and charts for better interpretation.

## Future Improvements
- Include external factors like temperature, holidays, and marketing efforts.
- Implement ensemble models for improved accuracy.
- Deploy as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.
